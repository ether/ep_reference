## Installation
Install using /admin/plugins or npm install ep_reference

## Usage

## TODO
* Perhaps load Reference contents on hover?
* Stop CSS being applied from pad contents in current DOM (probably use iframe)
* Security Audit
* Styling
* Only allow "Create reference" once text is selected
* On click/hover of reference content have it jump to correct point in reference document not entire reference document
* Write test coverage
